      "description": "I am a passionate full stack developer from Algiers, Algeria, with a deep interest in artificial intelligence and software architecture. My journey into technology began at the University of Algiers, where I completed a Master's degree in AI-oriented computer systems engineering. During that time, I discovered how intelligent systems can transform industries by combining data, logic, and creativity. This academic background gave me a solid understanding of machine learning, data processing, and natural language technologies, which continue to influence my approach to development today. After graduation, I entered the consulting world as an ERP developer at Focus Systems Algeria, where I specialized in Odoo solutions. This experience taught me how to align business processes with technical solutions, build modular architectures, and deliver real value to companies through efficient software systems. I later joined the Algerian Port Community System as a developer and integrator, where I contributed to large-scale enterprise projects that improved communication and logistics efficiency across the port ecosystem. These roles strengthened my backend development skills and gave me hands-on experience in database design, API creation, and scalable system integration. Building upon my AI background and professional experience, I decided to pursue a second Master's degree in Full Stack Application Development at the University of Corsica. I am currently completing this program as an apprentice at Qualitaire Corse, where I work on developing hybrid solutions that merge AI-driven intelligence with practical business applications. My current focus is on designing efficient architectures that enable interoperability and scalability across systems. I’m highly motivated by the vision of becoming a software architect who can bridge the gap between artificial intelligence and modern software engineering. By combining my strengths in backend development, AI integration, and data-driven design, I aim to create intelligent, adaptive, and future-ready digital solutions that make technology more human-centered and impactful."
